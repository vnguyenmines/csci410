1. Vincent Nguyen. I used ChatGPT to give myself a refresher and solve some parts of the problem with assembly. However, no code from ChatGPT was included in this project code/incorporated at all. The lecture slides helped me to get a good foundation/grasp of where to start and any programming mistakes or uncertainties I experienced with the language was alleviated by the Rust documentation.
2. Overall, I spent around 10 hours on it (on and off and a little on break).
3. An aha moment was when I figured out the ambiguity and the process in the compilation process we were in as it was a little vague at the beginning even with the class material and online explaination. If anything, realizing the fact that we were translating virtual machine (also known as intermediate) code just like JVM/IR/etc. made me a lot more interested in what I was putting together and added to the joy of this class.
