An aha moment I had was when I realized the entire language syntax could be represented in a fixed set of string to binary mappings (developing a DFA/NFA would be a lot better/scalable/advanced but I wanted to experience what it was like taking this path). I certainly think using DFAs and NFAs is a lot better of an experiment and it helps the language make more sense instead of writing boilerplate.
